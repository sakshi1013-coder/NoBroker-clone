🏠 NoBroker Clone!!
A front-end clone of the NoBroker platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project recreates the core experience of NoBroker and introduces an exclusive premium membership system that enhances user interaction and visibility — all without a backend.

🌟 Highlight Feature: Premium Membership System
This clone includes a creative premium membership feature not seen in basic clones:

🔑 Premium Seeker or Owner Perks:
✅ Get a “Verified” tag on your profile

🏅 Unlock access to premium property listings

📬 Directly contact other premium members (without delay or restriction)

📊 If you're a Premium Owner, you can:

View stats about your property (like how many users visited your listing)

Gain higher visibility with verified badge and preferred search ranking

All these features are implemented using smart front-end logic and conditional rendering through JavaScript.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML – Structure of the site

CSS – Styling and layout (responsive design)

JavaScript – Interactivity, feature logic, premium membership control
